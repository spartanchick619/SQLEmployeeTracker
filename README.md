# SQL EMPLOYEE TRACKER

## Description
SQL Employee Tracker is a SQL employee database that is a command-line application. The user can interact with different prompts to add emplpoyees, departments, roles, and update information. This database was built with Inquirer, Node.js, and MySQL. I enjoyed building the databse for the CMS. I had challenges with the SQL site. I enjoyed working on the server and adding all the functions. For future development, the goal is to get it working and running and possibly add more prompts. 

## Installation
Invoke 'npm i ' in command line

## Usage
Open 'Integrated Terminal' on 'server.js' and enter 'node.server.js'. Use the 'up' and 'down' arrow keys to navigate the command line. Click 'enter' or 'return' on your choice. Follow command line prompts until the desired choice has been met.
